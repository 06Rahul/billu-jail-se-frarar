git add -p

Common usages and options for Git Commit
git commit: This starts the commit process, but since it doesn't include a -m flag for the message, your default text editor will be opened for you to create the commit message. If you haven't configured anything, there's a good chance this will be VI or Vim. (To get out, press Esc, then :wq, and then Enter. :wink:)
git commit -m "descriptive commit message": This starts the commit process, and allows you to include the commit message at the same time.
git commit -am "descriptive commit message": In addition to including the commit message, this option allows you to skip the staging phase. The addition of -a will automatically stage any files that are already being tracked by Git (changes to files that you've committed before).
git commit --amend: Replaces the most recent commit with a new commit. (More on this later!)
